## Features

<img align="right" alt="Staking Stats" src="https://github.com/cheesits456/0xDiscordBot/raw/readme-images/stats.png" width="315">

### Live statistics about ZRX staking

<p align="justify">Provides information about the current staking epoch, such as the total ZRX currently staked, or how much time is remaining until the epoch expires. Stats are provided in the form of viewable but unjoinable voice channels, collapsable under their own category at the top of the server's channel list.</p>

### Live statistics about ZRX network volume

<p align="justify">Provides information about the total dollar value (USD) of all trades on the ZRX network for the past 24 hours, as well as all time. Similar to the staking stats, the network volume statistics also use a voice channel in its own collapsable category.</p>

### Live channel feed of all ZRX network transactions

<p align="justify">Utilizes the <a href="https://docs.0xtracker.com/api-reference/introduction">0x Tracker API</a> to post details about every transaction on the ZRX Network to a read-only text channel in Discord. The Discord messages also contain a link to that transaction's page on the 0x Tracker website, as well as a Twitter link to draft a new Tweet about the transaction.</p>
